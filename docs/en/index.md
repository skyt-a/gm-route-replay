# Google Map Route Replay Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Google Map Route Replay.

This library allows you to replay route data with time information on Google Maps.
It supports high-performance rendering using `WebGLOverlayView` (optional, recommended for many markers) and standard `google.maps.Marker` rendering (default), as well as simultaneous playback of multiple tracks (moving entities).
