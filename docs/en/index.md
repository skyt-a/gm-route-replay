# GoogleMaps Route Replay Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for GoogleMaps Route Replay.

This library allows you to replay route data with time information on Google Maps.
It supports high-performance rendering using `WebGLOverlayView` (optional, recommended for many markers) and standard `google.maps.Marker` rendering (default), as well as simultaneous playback of multiple tracks (moving entities).
